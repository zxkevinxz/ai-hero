We've now built the structure of our loop, but we're not persisting the state of the system to the backend.

We can see this because when we refresh the page, the AI messages are lost.

## Adjusting our schema

The shape of our messages has slightly changed since we last worked on persistence. We're now storing annotations as well as parts.

- `annotations` are being used to show the reasoning steps in the UI
- `parts` contain the `text` content of the message

We need to adjust our schema to reflect this. We'll need to add a new `annotations` field to the `messages` table, and make it `json`.

## Fixing `onFinish`

We have an `onFinish` being passed to our loop, but it's never called. First things first, we should pass that to the function that answers the question.

```ts
streamText({
  onFinish: opts.onFinish, // from the parameters above
});
```

## Collecting the annotations

However we also need to make sure the annotations we're attaching to the message are collected.

We can do that in the scope of the `/api/chat` route, by saving the annotations in a temporary variable:

```ts
import type { OurMessageAnnotation } from "./types";

const annotations: OurMessageAnnotation[] = [];

// ...existing code

const writeMessageAnnotation = (
  annotation: OurMessageAnnotation,
) => {
  // Save the annotation in-memory
  annotations.push(annotation);
  // Send it to the client
  dataStream.writeMessageAnnotation(annotation);
};
```

Then, when the loop has finished, we can save the annotations to the database. The plan here is, before upserting the chat and its messages, we'll manually add the annotations to the last message

```ts
streamText({
  // ...existing code
  onFinish: async () => {
    // Get the last message
    const lastMessage = messages[messages.length - 1];
    if (!lastMessage) {
      return;
    }

    // Add the annotations to the last message
    lastMessage.annotations = annotations;

    // Upsert the chat and its messages
    await upsertChat({
      messages,
    });
  },
});
```

You'll then also need to go into `upsertChat` and ensure that the annotations are saved to the database, along with the `role` and `parts`.

## Steps To Complete

- Read the existing Drizzle schemas file.
- Read the existing DB helper functions.
- Read the existing 'answer question' code.
- Add a new `annotations` field to table where the messages are stored. It should be `json`, and optional.
- Adjust the helper functions to save the annotations to the database, adjust the places the messages are fetched to include the annotations.
- Make sure the `onFinish` function is passed to the `streamText` function in the answer question code.
- Adjust the `/api/chat` route to collect the annotations (via the `writeMessageAnnotation` function), append them to the last message, and then pass the updated messages to the `upsertChat` function.
- Check it in the UI to see if it works.
