We've been doing a pretty good job so far at displaying the content to the user. But as soon as we exit our window, the chat messages disappear. We need to find a way to persist the chat messages over time.

To do that, we're going to use our existing database setup using Drizzle. We're going to be creating `messages` and `chats` tables to store the chat messages.

The chats are going to be displayed on the left hand side of the screen as a way for the user to reference previous chats. When the user clicks on one of these previous chats, we'll store the ID of that chat in the URL via query parameters. Then we'll fetch that chat with all of its messages and display it in the right-hand side.

Both of those functions are going to be stored in helper functions: `getChat` and `getChats`.

We're also going to need to save the chat each time a new message is added. To do that, we're going to create an upsert chat function. This will serve two purposes. When the user asks the first question in a chat, `upsertChat` will be used to create a new chat with the new message. When the AI replies, the `upsertChat` function will add the new message to the existing chat.

I found that treating the chat as a single entity, instead of handling individual messages, is the most robust way to do this. This means that `upsertChat` will delete all of the existing messages and replace them with the new ones.

## Steps to complete

Create the database resources:

- Create tables in the databases for `messages` and `chats` in Drizzle
- Each chat should contain multiple messages
- Each chat should belong to a user
- Each message should have a role (string), parts (json) and order (int)
- Run the migrations so that the database is up to date

Create helper functions:

- `upsertChat`: Create a chat, with all the messages. Should fail if the chat does not belong to the logged in user. If the chat already exists, it should delete all existing messages and replace them with the new ones. If the chat does not exist, it should create a new chat with the id passed in.

```ts
import type { Message } from "ai";

export const upsertChat = async (opts: {
  userId: string;
  chatId: string;
  title: string;
  messages: Message[];
}) => {
  // ...implementation
};
```

- `getChat`: Get a chat by id with its messages
- `getChats`: Get all chats for a user, without the messages

## Not required yet:

- Implement the `deleteChat` and `deleteMessage` functions
- Implement the `updateMessage` function
- Hooking up the frontend to the backend
