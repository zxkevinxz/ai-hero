Another classic use case for LLMs is classification.

Let's say we want to pass a user comment to the LLM to classify as `positive`, `negative`, or `neutral`.

We want to get back from the LLM essentially one string, and that string is going to be either `positive`, `negative`, or `neutral`.

In traditional software parlance, this is called an enum — a set of enumerated values.

And we can use the AI SDK to generate that enum.

# !!steps

We're using the `generateObject` function again, but this time we're passing an output of `enum`.

```ts ! example.ts
import { generateObject } from "ai";

export const classifySentiment = async (
  text: string,
) => {
  await generateObject({
    model,
    output: "enum",
    prompt: text,
    system:
      `Classify the sentiment of the text as either ` +
      `positive, negative, or neutral.`,
  });
};
```

# !!steps

We also pass an `enum` property with an array of the possible strings we want it to return.

```ts ! example.ts
import { generateObject } from "ai";

export const classifySentiment = async (
  text: string,
) => {
  await generateObject({
    model,
    output: "enum",
    enum: ["positive", "negative", "neutral"],
    prompt: text,
    system:
      `Classify the sentiment of the text as either ` +
      `positive, negative, or neutral.`,
  });
};
```

# !!steps

The result we get back from `generateObject` has an `object` property, and that object is our enum.

```ts ! example.ts
import { generateObject } from "ai";

export const classifySentiment = async (
  text: string,
) => {
  const { object } = await generateObject({
    model,
    output: "enum",
    enum: ["positive", "negative", "neutral"],
    prompt: text,
    system:
      `Classify the sentiment of the text as either ` +
      `positive, negative, or neutral.`,
  });

  return object;
};
```

Let's try out a few different statements to see if it works:

<Scrollycoding>

# !!steps

`I'm not sure how I feel` comes out as `neutral`.

```ts ! example.ts
const result = await classifySentiment(
  `I'm not sure how I feel`,
);

console.log(result); // neutral
```

# !!steps

`This is terrible` comes out as `negative`.

```ts ! example.ts
const result = await classifySentiment(
  `This is terrible`,
);

console.log(result); // negative
```

# !!steps

And `I love this so much` comes out as `positive`.

```ts ! example.ts
const result = await classifySentiment(
  `I love this so much`,
);

console.log(result); // positive
```

And just like that, we've got a sentiment analysis system. This is a really cool use case for enums, and it's great that the AI SDK makes it so simple.
